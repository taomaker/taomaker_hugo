Today Iâ€™m happy to release the verified design of Rolleiflex SL26 TaoAdapter for Sony E-mount cameras. The first machined version was designed back in 2015 by G. Hou, my star in optics. I later revised the design to make it fit for 3D printing.

The design has been verified on 4 SL26s so feel worry free to print yours.
