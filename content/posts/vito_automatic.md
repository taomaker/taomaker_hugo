This is a long delay. I had a Voigtlander Color-Skopar 50/2.8 from the Bessamatic years ago and I always like the color rendation when using on the Sony Alpha 300. Last year I got a Vito Automatic I with a Lanthar lens. Up till today I finally mounted it on my Sony A6000.

The lens here is Lanthar 50/2.8.

3D print design has two files, a black body, and a color ring. I printed the ring in Voigtlander blue, the blue used by them back in the 1950s.
