ledger-cli is one of the [text-based productivity tools](text_based_tools) I used frequently.

I used to use Mint.com to collect my income and expenses. It helped me a lot showing the snap shot of our family finance conditions. The main problem we found, is that we have to frequently update the login creditials for connected accounts. Some accounts are never supported. There is no way to track business related expenses. Another minority issue, is that the report format is fixed, but we need a customized report for our monthly finance review.

In the search of a platform-independent finance management tool, I found [ledger-cli](http://www.ledger-cli.org/). Here are the features I like most:

1. One journal is one text file. I can edit it with text editors on many device.
2. It is a double-entry system.
3. It forces me to keep a transaction journal.
4. Accounts can be created on the fly.
5. It is super fast.

Since Jan 2018 I have been maintaining our family journal. By June this year I will share some of my best practices and routines with ledger-cli.
